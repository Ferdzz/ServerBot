## ServerBot - A fun Spigot/Bukkit plugin for Minecraft Servers (README still in progress)
ServerBot is a fun little Spigot/Bukkit plugin that is meant to add life to a Minecraft server without taking too much of a toll on the overall concept of the Vanilla game. The plugin also serves as my reintroduction into both Java development and Spigot plugin development. The goal here was to create something that was fun and usable but also something that is remotely challenging for me to work on to get my skills back in check, or at a working level once again.

ServerBot has a multitude of fun little features, mostly games that are text-based that allow players on the server to interact
with one another. 
- Eightball: Players can ask a question and expect a response much like that of a real eightball.
- Spin the bottle: Players can spin the bottle, it randomly chooses two people that are online in the server.
- Coin toss: Gives players the ability to let a virtual coin make their decisions
- Roll: Allows players to roll for a random number within the bounds in which they define with a paramter thats required in the command.
- Cat: Sends the player a link to a random cat picture!
- Bye: Sends a farewell to the player displaying a link to a farewell picture!
